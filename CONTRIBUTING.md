# Contributing to neuron

Contributions are highly appreciated. Please note the following guidelines:

## Autoformatting

I autoformat every Haskell source using [ormolu](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu). Before opening a PR you are encouraged to do the same. However if you have trouble installing ormolu for whatever reason, don't let that prevent you from contributing.

## Tests

At the moment, adding [unit tests](https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/33) before working on any significant features is the priority. This is something to keep in mind if you are planning on opening a feature PR soon. I'll remove this section as soon as unit tests are in place.
