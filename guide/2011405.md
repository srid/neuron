title: Web interface
---

Neuron can generate HTML out of your zettelkasten so that they may be viewed on any other device's web browser. It generates the HTML files under your Zettelkasten directory (by default at `~/zettelkasten`), in `.neuron/output/`, as well as spin up a server that will serve that generated site at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

```bash
neuron rib -wS
```

You can override the output directory path using `-o`.

The web interface can also be accessed without necessarily running the server. 

```bash
# Watch only, without serving
neuron rib -w
```

Leave this command running, and then use `neuron open` to directly open the locally generated HTML site.
