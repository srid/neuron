# Web interface

Neuron can generate a fully-functional and self-sufficient web site out of your zettelkasten. It generates the HTML files under your Zettelkasten directory, in `.neuron/output/`, as well as spin up a server that will serve that generated site at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

```bash
neuron rib -wS
```

The `rib` command takes a few options, notably:

* You can override the output directory path using `-o`.

* You can override server settings such as the host and port. For example,

    ```bash
    neuron rib -ws 127.0.0.1:8081
    ```

Additional CLI details are available via `--help`.

## Local site without server

The web interface can also be accessed without necessarily running the server.
First run rib in "watch mode" only (no http server):

```bash
# Watch only, without serving
neuron rib -w
```

Leave this command running in one terminal, and then use `neuron open` to directly open the locally generated HTML site.
