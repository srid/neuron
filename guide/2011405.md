title: Web interface
---

Neuron can generate HTML out of your zettelkasten so that they may be viewed on any other device's web browser. It generates the HTML files under your Zettelkasten directory (by default at `~/zettelkasten`), in `.neuron/output/`, as well as spin up a server that will serve that generated site at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

```bash
neuron rib -wS
```

The `rib` command takes a few options, notably:

* You can override the output directory path using `-o`.

* You can override server settings such as the host and port.

    ```bash
    neuron rib -ws 127.0.0.1:8081
    ```

Additional CLI details are available via `--help`.

```bash
neuron rib --help
```

## Local site without server

The web interface can also be accessed without necessarily running the server.
First run rib in "watch mode" only (no http server):

```bash
# Watch only, without serving
neuron rib -w
```

Leave this command running in one terminal, and then use `neuron open` to directly open the locally generated HTML site.
