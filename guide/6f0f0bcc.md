Neuron was designed with these criteria in mind:

* **Plain-text** format (Markdown), and **local storage**[^plain]
* Not tied to a single text editor[^editor] 
* Statically generated web site, for browsing and publishing on the web
* Remain as simple to use as possible

[^plain]: Store your notes however you want. We recommend [Git](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/), which enables full revision history of your notes for lifetime.
[^editor]: Text editors should ideally be *decoupled*, integrating via something like [LSP](https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/213). Both Emacs and VIM have extensions for neuron (see <4a6b25f1?cf>).
