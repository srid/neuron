# Hierarchical tags

Tags can be nested using a "tag/subtag" syntax, to allow a more fine-grained organization of your Zettelkasten, especially when using advanced queries as shown in [[2011506]].

For example, the following zettel is tagged "math/calculus/definition"

```markdown
---
tags:
  - math/calculus/definition
---

# Derivative
```

It will be included in the following tag queries:

- `math/**`
- `math/calculus/*`
- `math/calculus/definition`
- `**/definition`

See [[2011506]] to understand how to link zettels automatically based on tag patterns as above.

## Tag trees

Use `[[z:tags?filter=**]]` to render your entire tags set as a tree. Note that this only *renders* the tags; whereas `[[z:zettels?tag=...]]` of [[2011506]] exists to *link* to the zettels tagged with matching tags.
