title: Creating and Editing zettels
tags:

You may use any text editor with Markdown support to edit your zettel files. Neuron provides a command to create new zettel files with the suitable [2011403](zcf://zettel-id):

```bash
neuron new "My zettel title"
```

This command will print the path to the file created. Use `-e` to also open the text editor:


```bash
neuron new "My zettel title" -e
```

Newly created zettels will be a cluster of its own (see [2012301](z://cluster)) until you connect other zettels to them.

## Opening a Zettel by title

See [2013501](zcf://search).


## Editor integration

Emacs support is available via [zettel-mode.el](https://github.com/felko/zettel-mode).
