# Creating and Editing zettels

You may use any text editor with Markdown support to edit your zettel files. Neuron provides a command to create new zettel files with the suitable <2011403?cf>:

```bash
neuron new "My zettel title"
```

This command will print the path to the file created. Use `-e` to also open the text editor:


```bash
neuron new "My zettel title" -e
```

Newly created zettels will be a cluster of its own (see <2012301>) until you connect other zettels to them (see <2011504?cf>).

## Opening a Zettel by title
