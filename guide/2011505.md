# Zettel metadata

Every zettel must contain a "title" field in its metadata. Option metadata include "tags" and "date".

## Tags

You can attach one or more tags to your zettels:

```markdown
---
tags:
  - science
---
```

Tags can be also be nested; see <535407ad>. 

## Date

The creation date of the zettels can be specified in the "date" metadata field (`neuron new` automatically fills in this field):

```markdown
---
date: 2020-04-07
tags:
  - journal
---
```

The creation date can be made to display in a query result by using the `timeline` flag (see <2011506?cf>).
