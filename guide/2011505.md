# Zettel metadata

Zettels may contain optional metadata in the YAML frontmatter.

## Tags

You can attach one or more tags to your zettels using the "tags" metadata property[^kw]:

```markdown
---
tags:
  - science
---
```

Tags can be also be nested; see <535407ad>. 

[^kw]: For interoperability with other Zettelkasten apps, neuron accepts "keywords" as an alternative to "tags" in the YAML frontmatter.

## Date

The creation date of the zettels can be specified in the "date" metadata field (`neuron new` automatically fills in this field):

```markdown
---
date: 2020-04-07
tags:
  - journal
---
```

The creation date can be made to display in a query result by using the `timeline` flag (see <2011506?cf>).

## Pinning

Zettels can be pinned in the z-index so that they appear at the top. To pin a zettel, add the "pinned" tag to it.

```markdown
---
tags:
  - pinned 
---
```
