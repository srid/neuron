title: Zettel metadata
---

You zettels can contain custom metadata. Neuron supports "tags" as builtin. For example:

```markdown
---
title: Gravity
tags:
  - science
---
```

Tags can also be nested using a "tag/subtag" syntax, to allow a more fine-grained organization of your Zettelkasten, especially when using advanced queries as shown in [2011506](zcf://linking-to-multiple-zettels).
