Here is a list of public Zettelkastens that are managed by neuron:

- [haskell.srid.ca](https://haskell.srid.ca/) ([source](https://github.com/srid/haskell-zettelkasten)): A public Zettekasten for the [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) community.
- [www.srid.ca](https://www.srid.ca/) ([source](https://github.com/srid/srid.ca)): Personal homepage of Srid; also demonstrates using Neuron as a library.

If you are hosting your own Zettelkasten publicly and would like to include it in this list, edit this page (using the link below) to open a pull request.
