# Folgezettel Heterarchy

Neuron allows you to organically build a <2011407?cf> out of your Zettelkasten over time. When a zettel links (see <2011504?cf>) to another, it "branches off"[^folge] to that zettel ... unless `cf` is used (in which case it is not a branch off). 

A folgezettel heterarchy differs from a traditional "category tree" in two key ways:

* It is built *organically* over time based on the connections formed, instead of being pre-defined.
* A note can have *multiple* parents.

The heterarchy is displayed in the following places

* z-index: Full folgezettel heterarchy of the zettelkasten.
* [[[5e41fd32]]]: Subset of the above, branching off to the zettel.

[^folge]: Hence the German compound word "*[folge](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Folge#German)-[zettel](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Zettel#German)*". Read <https://zettelkasten.de/posts/kinds-of-ties/>
