title: Short links
---

You can write
```markdown
<2008403>
```

instead of

```markdown
[2008403](z:)
```

to link to a zettel. This is an experimental feature that will probably be
extended to support other types of links.
See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/59) for details.
