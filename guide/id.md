# Zettel ID

A Zettel ID is an unique identifier that refers to a particular zettel. By default, neuron will use random alphanumeric IDs of length 8, called a "random ID". But you may use arbitrary text as ID as well, called a "title ID".

## When to use *title IDs*

A title ID is one that uses arbitrary phrases (with whitespace characters). For example, in the link `[[Some note title]]` (see [[2011504]]), "Some note title" is the title ID, which is generated in the [[2011405]] as the HTML file named "Some_note_title.html".

Use title IDs when you want truly future-proof link IDs that work on any text editor. However, note that this comes at the cost that you are willing to rename them (manually or using a script) across your Zettelkasten if the title ID of any of your notes changes.

## When to prefer *random IDs*

The advantage to using random IDs (which neuron uses by default) is that you do not have to rename links across your Zettelkasten when changing the title of a note. This makes the links slightly less future-proof, however, because for most convenient editing experience you now have to rely on using a text editor (see [[editor]]) that supports expanding them with the title from the note text.
