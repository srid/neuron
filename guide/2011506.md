title: Linking to multiple zettels
---

You may create a query that will list the matching zettels automatically. For example, to include a list of a zettels with the "science" tag (from the example at [2011505](zcf://metadata)):

```markdown
[.](zquery://search?tag=science&linkTheme=withDate)
```

You can use the CLI to see which zettels will be included in a given query; see [2013501](zcf://searching).

## Example

As an example here is a list of zettels tagged "walkthrough" on this very
Zettelkasten:

[.](zcfquery://search?tag=walkthrough)

It was created by `[.](zcfquery://search?tag=walkthrough)`. Note that here we use `zcfquery` to not affect the graph; whereas `zquery` will form the appropriate new connections to the listed notes.

## Hierarchical tags

Queries can also link to zettels whose tags match a glob pattern. For instance, `[.](zquery://search?tag=science/*)` will link to all zettels tagged "science/physics" and "science/biology".

Recursive globs are supported too, so if you want to include deeper nested tags, `[.](zquery://search?tag=science/**)` will also match them (e.g. "science/physics/kinematics"). This will also include zettels that are tagged "science" only, though this behavior can be avoided by querying "science/\*/\*\*" instead.
