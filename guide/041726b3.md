# Cerveau

[**Cerveau**](https://www.cerveau.app/) is a web and mobile app for easy editing and publishing of Neuron notes backed by [Git](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) as storage.

Cerveau is currently in public beta. Everybody can sign-in to try it out, and [Neuron sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/srid) get full access (unlimited notes) to it, while [facilitating the eventual open-sourcing](https://twitter.com/sridca/status/1302280845902970883) of Cerveau.
