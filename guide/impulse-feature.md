# Impulse

:::{.ui .message}
Impulse is a very new feature[^gh], which is to be improved with more useful graph querying capabilities in the coming months.
:::

Impulse is the dynamic part of the otherwise statically-generated [[web]]. 

It displays the zettelkasten [[[folgezettel-heterarchy]]] for all [[[2012301]]] in the zettelkasten graph, as well provides a way to filter them by searching.
