# Graph visualization

A zettelkasten is a [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph). Neuron also has an unique notion of [[[folgezettel-heterarchy]]], which is a *subset* of this graph established by having zettels "branch off" to other zettels.

There are two modes of visualization these graph connections:

## [[impulse-feature]]

In an otherwise statically-generated neuron site, [[[impulse-feature]]] represents its *dynamic* part.

## Uplinks and Backlinks

A backlink of a zettel is a zettel that links to it. If that link is a folgezettel link, it is called an "uplink". Each zettel has its [[5e41fd32]] displayed at the top.
