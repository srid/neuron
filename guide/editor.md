# Editor integration

While you may use any text editor with neuron, the following extensions enable certain neuron-specific features on top of basic text editing.

## Emacs 

Emacs support is available via [neuron-mode](https://github.com/felko/neuron-mode), which supports nifty editor features like opening a zettel by title, linking to other zettels by title, as well as displaying the title of the zettel next to the link (see screenshot below).

## Vim

See [this fork of neuron.vim](https://github.com/fiatjaf/neuron.vim).

## VSCode

These two extensions are useful when editing your Neuron notes in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

* [vscode-memo](https://github.com/svsool/vscode-memo#memo) - supports both kinds of wikilinks
* [markdown-links](https://github.com/tchayen/markdown-links) - supports only `[[..]]` style link, [but not folgezettel](https://github.com/tchayen/markdown-links/issues/59) (`[[[...]]]`).

Note that advanced features of neuron like [[2011506]] will not be supported by either of these extensions. [LSP support](https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/213) is ideal, but it has not been implemented by anyone yet.

## Online

[[cerveau]] can be used to edit your notes online using a web browser. Here's a small demo of the Cerveau editor in action, demonstrating the link autocomplete feature.
