# Declarative Install

If you use [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), add the following to your `environment.systemPackages` list:


```nix
(let neuronSrc = builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/srid/neuron/archive/master.tar.gz";
  in import neuronSrc {})
```

If you use [home-manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager), add the above to your `home.packages` list.

## Pinning versions

It is generally recommended to pin your imports in Nix. The above expression will fetch the then `master` branch, which is not what you want for reproducibility. Pick a revision from [the commit history](https://github.com/srid/neuron/commits/master), and then use it, for example:

```nix
# Use this for neuron 0.5 or above only.
(let neuronRev = "GITREVHERE";
     neuronSrc = builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/srid/neuron/archive/${neuronRev}.tar.gz";
  in import neuronSrc {})
```

In the future if you decide to upgrade neuron, simply change the revision hash to a newer one.

## Systemd service

If you use [home-manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager), you can also
run neuron as a systemd service; see [[[6479cd5e]]].
