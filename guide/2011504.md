title: Linking
---

To link to another zettel, use the following syntax:

```markdown
This is a zettel file, which links to another zettel:

- <2008403>.

You may also annotate the link (ignored by neuron):

- [foo-bar](2008403).
```

The `z:` protocol instructs neuron to automatically create a link between the associated zettels, which ultimately affects your zettel graph. Neuron also renders the link along with the ID and title of the linked zettel.

If your link is merely a reference to another zettel, and you do not wish it to be also a graph connection, use `[2008403](zcf://)` instead. Neuron will link the zettels, but the link would be ignored when building the [2011503](zcf://graph-view).
