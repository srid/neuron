title: Linking

To link to another zettel, use the following syntax:

```markdown
This is a zettel file, which links to another zettel:

* <2008403>
```

Any <2011403?cf> placed inside angle brackets instructs neuron to automatically
create a link between the associated zettels, which ultimately affects the
category tree of your zettel graph. In <2011405?cf>, neuron will automatically
display the title of the linked zettel.

If your link is merely a reference to another zettel, and you do not wish it to
be part of the category tree, but only the graph connection, use the `cf` query
flag (eg: `<2008403?cf>`). Neuron will link the zettels, but the link would be
ignored when building the <2017401?cf> .

## Advanced linking
