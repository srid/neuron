# Linking

To link to another zettel, put the [[2011403]] inside `[[[..]]]` or `[[..]]`[^autolink]:

```
This is a zettel file, which links (branches of) to another zettel:

* [[[ef3dke98]]]
```

Such a link instructs neuron to automatically create a connection between the
associated zettels, which ultimately affects the [[2017401]] of your zettel
graph. In [[2011405]], neuron will automatically display the title of the
linked zettel.


## Non-branching links

If your link is merely a reference to another zettel, and you do not wish it to
be part of the [[2017401]] and the linked zettel's [[5e41fd32]], use a non-folgezettel wiki link: (eg: `[[ef3dke98]]`). 

```
This is a zettel file, which refers to another zettel without 
branching to it:

* [[ef3dke98]]
```

Neuron will link the zettels, but the link would be ignored from [[2017401]]
as well as the [[5e41fd32]] of zettel with ID "ef3dke98". 

## Advanced linking

[^cf]: 
    > The abbreviation cf. (short for the Latin: *confer/conferatur*, both meaning "compare") is used in writing to refer the reader to other material to make a comparison with the topic being discussed. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cf.)

[^autolink]:
    Neuron used to use "autolink" style linking. `<ef3dke98>` is the
    same as `[[[ef3dke98]]]`; and `<ef3dke98?cf>` is the same as
    `[[ef3dke98]]`. Autolinks are supported for backwards compatibility only;
    users are recommended to use the new wiki-style links.
