# Adding images and other files

Create a folder named "static" in your Zettelkasten directory, and add your
images and files to it. Neuron will automatically copy them as is to the output
folder. You may reference them from the Markdown file using relative links.

For example, suppose you have copied a file called `rose.png` to your `static`
folder, you can then include it in your Markdown as:

```markdown
![Rose](./static/rose.png)
```

## Special files

Neuron treats certain files as special. See [[[67c6f7a0]]]
