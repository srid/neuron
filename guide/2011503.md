# Graph view

A zettelkasten is a [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph). Neuron also has the notion of <2017401>, which is a subset of this graph established by having zettels "branch off" to other zettels.

## z-index 

The z-index page (at `/z-index.html`; also linked in the header) displays the zettelkasten <2017401> for all <2012301> in the zettelkasten graph.

## Uplinks and Backlinks

A backlink of a zettel is a zettel that links to it. If that link is a folgezettel link, it is called an "uplink". Each zettel has its <5e41fd32?cf> displayed at the top.
