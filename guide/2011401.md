Zettelkasten is a smart note taking system created by a German sociologist, whose productivity increased to epic proportions due to it[^dclear]. 

All notes in a Zettelkasten are linear, <2012101>, with links created between them, enabling a <2011407> to evolve organically, rather than having to preconceive a hierarchy ahead (as is the case with outliners like Workflowy and Dynalist).
