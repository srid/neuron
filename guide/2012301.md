title: Clusters

Your Zettelkasten may have two or more clusters, not [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_graph) to one another.  The z-index will display these clusters, with each cluster rendered as a [forest](https://tinyurl.com/wikipedia-forest), whose roots (aka "[mother](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-mother-vertex-in-a-graph/) zettels") could be considered as a portal zettel into that sub-Zettelkasten.
