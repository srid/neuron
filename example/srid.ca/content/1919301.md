I got into [sous vide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sous-vide) cooking in Fall
2017 and have been using it ever since.

## Equipment

* **Circulator:** I own [the
  Anova](https://anovaculinary.com/anova-precision-cooker/) however if I were to
  buy a new machine I'd definitely go for [the
  Joule](https://www.chefsteps.com/joule) by Chef Steps because the latter is
  compact and has a magnetic base \(allowing use of existing pots\).

* **Container:** I use the Rubbermaid 12 quart container with the Anova; however
  if you use the Joule most kitchen pots should work.

* **Rack:** Racks are used to hold the bags in water and prevent them from
  floating which can affect the cooking. While there are racks specifically made
  for sous vide, for beginners I recommend the _Ikea Stainless Steel Pot Lid
  Organizer_.

* [**Vacuum
  sealer**](https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/so-you-wanna-buy-a-vacuum-sealer):
  To begin with I suggest not buying a vacuum sealer and instead use zip lock
  bags for sealing the meat using the [water immersion
  technique](https://anovaculinary.com/sous-vide-water-displacement-method/). If
  you are cooking sous vide often you may invest in any functioning suction
  vacuum sealer \(I use the Gourmia model that cost me about 50 CAD\).

  * The only disadvantage of using a _suction_ vacuum sealer, over the superior
    _chamber_ vacuum sealer, is that suction vacuum bags generally cost more
    money over time.

* **Torch**: Sous Vide technique _cooks_ meat, but does not _sear_ \(aka.
  [maillard reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction)\) it. You
  can sear a steak on a hot pan for about a minute per side, but if you do not
  wish to smoke out the entire kitchen an alternative is to use a propane torch.
  The _Bernzomatic TS8000_ is the best choice here; I'd recommend that you use
  it _without_ the \(IMO\) overhyped and
  [inefficient](https://www.chefsteps.com/forum/posts/you-dont-need-the-searzall)
  Searzall attachment.

* [**Sous Vide
  Everything**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpFuaxD-0PKLolFR3gWhrMw)
  channel on YouTube: lots of video recipes, and tips. These guys use the TS8000
  on almost every video. However they use it with the Searzall attachment which
  \(IMO\) unnecessarily prolongates the searing process.

* [**The Reverse
  Sear**](https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/03/how-to-reverse-sear-best-way-to-cook-steak.html):
  another method to cook a steak. Compared to sous vide, a steak cooked in the
  oven gets that roast flavour. And because the steak already comes out dry,
  searing it after \(I still use the TS8000\) produces a much better and
  crispier browning than a sous vide steak that was pat dried with paper towels.
