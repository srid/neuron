For most of my adult life, growing up in
[Chennai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai) and the initial few years in
Canada, I remained physical unfit. South Asians in general do not prioritize
fitness as much as other endeavors \(like academic success\) which may explain
why they tend to have [less favorable body
composition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4821815/) and exhibit
[increased risk](https://www.masalastudy.org) for heart disease. And sitting in
front of the computer for a large part of the day just does not help. I had bad
posture, and was not using all of the body muscles to their full efficiency.

## Fitness industry is a sham

I started by lifting weights in the gym \(my apartment had one\), however it was
such an unexciting experience ... which naturally lead me to calisthenics. I
think the whole fitness industry is overrated, and avoid it like plague.

## Strength vs Hypertrophy

My goal is to develop _functional_ strength---the strength one gains from
resistance training should translate to everyday physical activities that we
take for granted. Hypertrophy \(beyond the necessary level to achieve the
desired strength\) however is an anti-goal; I find it fatuous to carry all that
extra muscle around and ravenously eating more to maintain it.

incidentally, [eats one meal a day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKXOBxcNF3E))

As a result of doing calisthenics I noticed normal activities like walking and
standing becoming "more efficient," in that my posture has dramatically improved
owing to the direct translation of intent, and eventual habituation, to keep the
correct body alignment \(which is what one means by "correct form"\) throughout
any movement.

## Getting Started

For someone sedentary like me I'm glad that I began with a program that focuses
on _higher reps_ at a _lower intensity_: [**Convict
Conditioning**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2G0WUH73YBFYE)
\(which does [exactly
that](https://old.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/atv610/im_surprised_this_is_not_featured_in_the_rr/#form-t1_eh405onmus)\).

Higher reps at a lower intensity, especially in the beginning, is important to
avoid unnecessary injuries:

> One of the major problems with modern forms of strength and resistance training is the damage they do to the joints. The joints of the body are supported by delicate soft tissues—tendons, fascia, ligaments and bursae—which are simply not evolved to take the pounding of heavy weight-training. Weak areas include the wrists, elbows, knees, lower back, hips, the rhomboid-complex, spine, and neck. The shoulders are particularly susceptible to damage from bodybuilding motions. You’ll be lucky to find anybody who has been lifting weights for a year or more who hasn’t developed some kind of chronic joint pain in one of these areas.

Nowadays I practice a technique known as [greasing the
groove](https://sealgrinderpt.com/blog/navy-seal-workout/pavels-grease-the-groove-gtg.html/)
\(GtG\), which allows me to practice on a daily basis.

I do plan on taking formal gymnastic practice, although where I live gymnastic
centers tend to cater exclusively to children.

  _experientially_ understanding the role of body alignment in calisthenics.
