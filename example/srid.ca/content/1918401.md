I eat exclusively meat.

## Why?

In early 2013 a reckless general medical practitioner prescribed me enough antibiotics to [mess up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysbiosis) my gut microbiome. This lead to what was then a mild folliculitis to become severe chronic folliculitis with chronic seborrhoeic dermatitis following suit.

I suffered with this condition for over 4 years, and saw plethora of dermatologists \(who knew naught but to prescribe ever more antibiotics\). Then, just within two weeks of going on the carnivore diet \(beef, salt and pepper\) my symptoms reduced to about 95%.

## Is it safe?

Contrary to popular belief, the carnivore diet provides all the necessary nutrients and is generally safe to do long-term. Meat is [nutritionally complete food](http://www.diagnosisdiet.com/food/meats/), and [some indigenous groups](https://justmeat.co/peoples/) have traditionally eaten an all-meat diet.

One ought to pay lip service to general medical wisdom and any dominant nutrition ideology as they are laced with an anti-meat bias \(see below\) using [problematic epidemiological studies](https://www.diagnosisdiet.com/epidemilogical-studies/) where, depending on the researcher's nutritional bias, one can establish [_any_ food item to be problematic](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/97/1/127/4576988). For a telling instance of how biased health organizations can be, refer to Dr. David M Klurfeld's [report](https://peakhuman.libsyn.com/dr-david-klurfeld-on-meat-not-causing-cancer-bogus-vegetarian-scientists-and-balanced-nutrition) of his experience with a WHO working group:

* \[Dr. David M Klurfeld\] was on the World Health Organization working group to decide if meat causes cancer in 2015 with a bunch of vegetarians and vegans and says it was the most frustrating professional experience of his life
* There were 22 scientists - half of which were epidemiologists
* They claimed they used 800 studies but they actually only used 18
* There was a group of people that were strongly against the vote
* He thinks a number of the people made up their minds before they even arrived
