Traditional note taking methods, including outliners (Workflowy, Dynalist) necessitate creation of *preconceived* hierarchies, built "top-down". In contrast, the **heterarchy** of Zettelkasten is built organically from "bottom-up" via gradual forming of links between the notes.

Per [David Clear](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125):

> **Don’t worry about structure**: Don’t worry about putting notes in neat folders or into unique preconceived categories. [As Schmidt put it](https://sociologica.unibo.it/article/view/8350/8270), in a Zettelkasten “there are no privileged positions” and “there is no top and no bottom.” The organization develops organically.

So even if you 'get it' as soon as you start playing around with the cards, you could reasonably expect to reap much greater gains over a timespan of months or years (at least, that's my experience!).
